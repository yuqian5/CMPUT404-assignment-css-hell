            <p>
                I am currently pursuing a Specialized Computing Science Degree at the University of Alberta. My 2 passions
                in life are coding and exploring the great outdoors.

                Recently, I made a website to keep track of the covid situation in Alberta.
                It is built in Angular and deployed to my personal Apache server hosted by Google GCloud.
                It provides detail statistics such as daily new case count and case status for each of the
                4 zones within Alberta in an intuitive and easy to read format while support both desktop and mobile view.

                In my spare time, I am a volunteer executive officer at the University of Alberta Outdoors Club.
                I developed a new inventory and rental management system using Android and Firebase that eliminates
                our paper use and reduces human error. I also volunteer at the University of Alberta Adaâ€™s Team where
                I provide free-of-charge weekly tutoring service for anyone enrolled in a 100/200 level computing science course.
